New features
  - if user passes git tagging and the current version is semantic, do not change anything
    - the user needs to pass --git --force if they wish to overwrite semantic version
  - Write changes in the changelog file (version name, date, commit messages since the last version) # this requires much work
  - Add support for other versioning conventions:
    - 0ver (https://0ver.org/)
    - CalVer (https://calver.org/)
