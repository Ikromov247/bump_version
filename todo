User documentation
- add better error handling, communicate the behavior to users in docs.

Improved development
- add contributing.md
- refactor code: break it down into several files and move into a core/ directory +

New features
- if user passes git tagging and the current version is semantic, do not change anything
 - the user needs to pass --git --force if they wish to overwrite semantic version
- Write changes in the changelog file (version name, date, commit messages since the last version) # this requires much work
- Add support for other versioning conventions: 
  - 0ver (https://0ver.org/)
  - CalVer (https://calver.org/)

Packaging:
- Publish the tool as a package on pip
